# Underfit and Overfit analysis with Learning_Curves

## Introduction
In this notebook, I have done a analysis of some classfication model for overfitting and underfitiing. Overfitting is the situation when the model by heart the dataset and does not perform well on the test data whereas Underfitting is just the opposite of overfitting, here it does not even learns well from the training data.

## Dataset
Have a look at the dataset [link](https://github.com/rajatsharma369007/Underfit_and_Overfit_analysis_with_Learning_Curves/blob/master/data.csv)  
The first 2 columns are x1 and x2 coordinates with last column as the labels.

## Installation
* pandas  
<code>conda install pandas</code>
* numpy  
<code>conda install numpy</code>
* scikit-learn
